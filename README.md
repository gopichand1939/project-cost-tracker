# 🧾 Project Cost Tracker

A React + Firebase-based web application that helps users efficiently manage the costs involved in a project by tracking both items and other expenses. This was built as part of the Karkhana Internship Assignment.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **Project Cost Tracker** allows authenticated users to:

- ✅ Add/Edit/Delete project **Items** (e.g., Laptop, Hosting)
- ✅ Add/Edit/Delete **Other Costs** (e.g., Shipping, Tax)
- ✅ Automatically calculate and display the **Total Project Cost**
- ✅ Securely log in and store their data in **Firebase Firestore**

The app is responsive, styled using **Chakra UI**, and manages state with **Redux Toolkit**.

## 🧑‍💻 How I Developed This

### 1. 🔧 Project Initialization

```bash
npm create vite@latest project-cost-tracker --template react
cd project-cost-tracker
npm install
````

### 2. 🛠️ Installed Dependencies

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
npm install firebase
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
npm install react-router-dom
npm install notistack
```

### 3. 🧱 Project Folder Structure

```bash
project-cost-tracker/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── firebase.js              # Firebase config and initialization
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── Login.jsx
│   │   ├── Register.jsx
│   │   └── Dashboard.jsx
│   ├── redux/

│   │   ├── itemsSlice.js
│   │   └── otherCostsSlice.js
│   ├── App.jsx
│   └── main.jsx
```

### 4. 🔐 Firebase Setup (Authentication & Firestore)

* Created a Firebase project
* Enabled **Authentication** → Email/Password
* Created **Firestore** database with rules:

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

* Firebase config was saved in `src/firebase.js`.
